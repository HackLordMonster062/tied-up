# Tied Up

An original card game involving strategy, luck, and a splash of creativity.

## Rules
Each player starts with 4 cards. 2 cards are set face up next to each other in the center of the table, those are the "middle cards". In the center is also an infinite pile of cards facing down. <br />
The game's goal is to get rid of all cards in your hand.

On each turn, a player needs to place down sets of cards. A set is one of the following:
- at least 2 cards with the same number
- at least 3 cards with adjacent numbers in any order (such as 2, 3, 4 or 6, 8, 7, 9)
- at least 4 cards of the same suit
  
Each set must include at least one of the middle cards. If for example one of the middle cards is a 3 of spades, the current player could place down 2 and 4 of any suit, or any other combination of cards following the above rules.

All cards of the same set that are placed down must be placed on the same middle card, but not necessarily the one that's part of the set, so in the previous example, the 2 and the 4 might not be placed on top of the 3 but instead on the other middle card. <br />
The player is free to choose which card ends up on top, which becomes the new middle card. 

The player can keep placing down sets, each following the middle cards set by the previous set, until they're out of sets or they wish to stop.
If any cards where placed down and the player did not run out of cards, 2 cards must be drawn from the pile, otherwise, only 1 card is drawn. Then, the turn ends and moves to the next player. 

The game continues until a player runs out of cards and wins.

The joker can act as any card, but cannot be placed at the top of a set.
